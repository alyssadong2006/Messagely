# Django-Blog-Project
This is a Django Blog Project called messagely_site
1. Use "pip install -r requirments.txt" to install the required modules
2. (Optional) run "python manage.py createsuperuser" to create an account
3. Run "python manage.py runserver" and click on the link shown in the cmd
4. (Optional) After arriving at the designated link, add "admin/" to the end of the link and enter the Django admin page
5. (Optional) You will arrive at a Django admin login screen
6. (Optional) Enter the username and password you used in step 3
7. (Optional) You can now add, and delete topics, posts, and comments into the database
8. Go back to the homepage and the stuff you deleted/added should be shown!
9. If ran locally, the default homepage link should be "http://127.0.0.1:8000/". "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" will bring you to the Django Admin page, where you can log in using your created superuser and change the database. Additionally, if somehow the superuser you created is not working, in the cmd, try typing "python manage.py makemigrations" followed by "python manage.py migrate".
